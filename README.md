# 2024 JAMB UTME Student Performance Analysis
Data analysis of 2024 JAMB UTME student performance, conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel (including Power Pivot/DAX). This project identifies actionable factors and modifiable student behaviors that significantly influence exam scores, aiming to provide practical insights for improvement. Features an interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

This data analysis project dives into the 2024 JAMB UTME (Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination) student performance data to identify key factors influencing scores. The primary goal is to uncover **actionable insights and modifiable behaviors** that can help students improve their results, and to provide valuable information for educators, parents, and policymakers.

## Problem Statement

While many factors are believed to influence student academic performance, it's crucial to identify which ones are most impactful and, importantly, which can be directly influenced by students themselves or by educational stakeholders. This project seeks to provide data-driven answers to questions such as:
* What is the relationship between study habits, attendance, and JAMB scores?
* How does teacher quality affect student outcomes across different socioeconomic backgrounds?
* What role does technological literacy play in a CBT (Computer-Based Test) environment?
* Are there specific advantages or disadvantages associated with school type or location?

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis comprises anonymized student performance records from the 2024 JAMB UTME. It includes various attributes such as:
* JAMB Scores
* Student Demographics (Age, Gender)
* Socioeconomic Status (SES)
* Educational Environment (School Type, Location)
* Study Habits (Study Hours, Attendance, Tutorials, Assignments Completed)
* Teacher Quality Ratings
* IT Knowledge Level

## Methodology

This project follows a typical data analysis workflow:
1.  **Data Collection & Loading:** Data was loaded into Microsoft Excel.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and ensured data types were appropriate for analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized Excel's built-in features, PivotTables, and charting capabilities to understand data distributions, identify initial patterns, and formulate hypotheses.
4.  **Advanced Analysis with Power Pivot & DAX:** Leveraged Excel's Power Pivot data model to create relationships between tables and developed custom measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for deeper insights (e.g., calculating conditional averages, analyzing interaction effects).
5.  **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Created an interactive dashboard in Excel using PivotCharts and Slicers to present key findings visually and allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
6.  **Conclusion & Recommendations:** Synthesized findings into actionable conclusions and practical recommendations for various stakeholders.

## Key Findings (Highlights)

* **Effort and Engagement are Paramount:** Study hours and high school attendance are overwhelmingly strong predictors of success. Consistent effort, including diligent assignment completion, is a direct pathway to higher scores.
* **Teacher Quality is Non-Negotiable:** Optimal teacher quality significantly elevates scores across all student demographics and is crucial for maximizing potential, even for highly advantaged students. However, it cannot entirely bridge the gaps caused by deep-seated socioeconomic disparities.
* **Socioeconomic Disparities Persist:** Students from higher SES consistently outperform others. While good teaching helps, fundamental inequities still exert a strong influence on outcomes.
* **Technological Literacy is Crucial:** High IT knowledge directly correlates with higher scores, emphasizing its importance in the CBT exam format.
* **Quality Over Type:** While private schools often show higher averages, exceptional teacher quality in public schools can lead to superior results, proving that quality of instruction can transcend institutional type.

## Recommendations

Based on these insights, actionable recommendations are provided for:
* **Students:** Emphasizing attendance, consistent study, and IT literacy.
* **Educators & Schools:** Focusing on teacher professional development, attendance incentives, and IT infrastructure.
* **Parents & Guardians:** Encouraging supportive study environments, attendance, and IT exposure.
* **Policymakers & Institutions:** Addressing socioeconomic disparities and investing in quality teaching and universal IT literacy.
